### A. Explain HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <ins>is the Web's application-layer protocol</ins>. It is implemented in two programs: a client program and a server program. The client program and server program, executing on different end systems, communicate by exchanging HTTP messages. HTTP defines the structure of these messages and how the client and server exchange them. This protocol follows a <ins>client-server model</ins> where browsers act as clients that send requests, and web servers respond with the requested content.
