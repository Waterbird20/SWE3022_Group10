# 2. Example

### A. What is the packet switching? What is this method for?

In a network application, end systems exchange messages with each other. To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system, <ins>the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as packets</ins>. Between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links and packet switches, of which there are two predominant types: routers and link-layer switches. This packet switching method enables <ins>efficient utilization of network resources</ins> by allowing multiple communications to share the same physical infrastructure simultaneously, rather than dedicating entire communication paths to individual conversations.
