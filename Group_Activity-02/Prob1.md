# 1. Example

### A. Explain the Internet protocol stack, and the encapsulation and the decapsulation of a user’s data by using air travel example


***Application Layer (Ticketing Service)***
At this highest layer, the user expresses a travel request similar to **purchasing an airline ticket**. In networking, this corresponds to user applications like web browsers requesting services such as accessing a web page.

***Transport Layer (Baggage Service)***
This layer ensures that the user's “luggage” (data) is safely tagged and tracked. Protocols like TCP guarantee reliable delivery **similar to how checked baggage is carefully managed**, while UDP is like carry-on luggage that travels faster with fewer guarantees.
