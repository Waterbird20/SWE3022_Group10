# 3. Domain Name System (DNS)

### A. Explain the Domain Name System (DNS).

***Domain Name System(DNS)*** is a fundamental Internet service that translates human-readable names into IP addresses, which are used by hosts and routers to deliver data. Technically, DNS is a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of many name servers. It operates as an application-layer protocol, where hosts and name servers communicate to resolve names into addresses (or vice versa). This allows users to use simple names while the underlying network uses numerical IP addresses for routing.
